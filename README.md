# Port-Congestion
A simple simulation of port congestion using Queues.
This is a simple program to be run from the command line.
It takes input from a text file and uses queues to simulate congestion at ports.
Each text file contains first the number of ports, then a list of numbers signifying a destination, and uses a queue implementation that I wrote myself to assign where this 'packet' is going.
